# CineGuess Technical Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture and dependencies for the CineGuess project, a movie-guessing web game, as of February 25, 2025. It serves as context for developers and LLM helpers working on the project.

## Project Overview
- **Name**: CineGuess
- **Type**: Web-based movie-guessing game
- **Goal**: Provide a fun, engaging experience for casual users (friends and family) through multiple game modes, hints, and leaderboards.
- **Target Audience**: Casual mobile web users.
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Google authentication with custom user profiles.
  - Game modes: Freeplay, Weekly Challenge, Daily Challenge.
  - Hint system with varying point costs.
  - Leaderboards and user statistics.
  - "Did You Mean?" feature for guesses, suggesting titles with 80-95% similarity after disregarding capitalization, punctuation, and articles (and prepositions in long titles); automatically counting 96+% similarity as correct.
- **Hosting**: cineguess.plutogang.xyz (accessed via plutogang.xyz homepage).
- **Primary Usage**: Mobile web browser.

## Technical Architecture
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React (single-page application, SPA).
- **State Management**: Zustand for global application state (e.g., user data, game progress, scores).
- **UI Library**: Chakra UI for consistent, accessible, and responsive UI components.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach, with breakpoints for tablets and desktops.
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation between pages (e.g., Home, Game, Profile, Challenges).

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Platform**: Firebase ecosystem for backend services.
  - **Firebase Auth**: Handles Google Sign-In for user authentication.
  - **Firestore**: Stores user data, movie metadata, challenge details, and leaderboards.
  - **Firebase Storage**: Manages static assets like movie posters and screenshots.
  - **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Optional for future notifications (e.g., challenge reminders).
  - **Firebase Cloud Functions**: Potential future use for automated leaderboard updates or challenge management.
- **Environment**: Configuration stored in `.env` (e.g., Firebase API keys, project IDs), excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Key Features
- **Authentication**: Google Sign-In integrated via `useAuth.js` and `AuthContext.js`, with user profiles managed in `UserProfile.js`.
- **Gameplay**: Movie guessing handled in `GameBoard.js`, `GuessInput.js`, and `HintButton.js`, with hints fetched from Firestore via `useMovieData.js`.
- **Challenges**: Current challenges displayed in `Challenge.js`, with a repository of unreleased challenges (200 total, released weekly) managed in `Challenges.js` and `useChallengeData.js`.
- **Guess Validation**: Custom logic in `guessChecker.js` (in `utils/`) for "Did You Mean?" suggestions (80-95% similarity) and automatic 96+% matches, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, articles, and prepositions in long titles.
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first design using Chakra UI, with loading states handled by `LoadingSpinner.js` and error feedback via alerts or toasts.

## Development Practices
- **Code Style**: Enforced with ESLint and Prettier for consistency and readability.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests planned for components, hooks, and utilities, supported by CI/CD pipelines in the GitHub repo (longhornadam/cineguess).
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes to ensure reliability and scalability.
- **Future Enhancements**: Potential AI-powered challenge generation and expanded Firebase Cloud Functions for automation.

## Dependencies
- React, React Router, Zustand, Chakra UI, Firebase SDKs (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging, Cloud Functions).

## Notes
- The `/meta` folder (including this file and `filestruc.txt`) is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to maintain project context for developers and LLMs.
- Sensitive data (e.g., Firebase configuration) is stored in `.env` and also excluded from version control.
- The project prioritizes security, accessibility, and performance, especially for mobile users.

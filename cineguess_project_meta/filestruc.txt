    - `Challenge/`: Challenge-related components.
      - `ChallengeList.js`: List of available or upcoming challenges.
      - `ChallengeDetail.js`: Detailed view of a specific challenge.
      - `ChallengeCard.js`: Preview card for individual challenges.
    - `LoadingSpinner.js`: Reusable loading indicator for async operations.
    - `Navbar.js`: Navigation bar for the application.
  - `contexts/`: React Contexts for global state management.
    - `AuthContext.js`: Manages authentication state across components.
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for logic encapsulation.
    - `useAuth.js`: Handles Firebase authentication logic.
    - `useMovieData.js`: Fetches and manages movie data from Firebase.
    - `useChallengeData.js`: Fetches and manages challenge data from Firebase.
  - `pages/`: Main application routes and page components.
    - `Home.js`: Home page for game mode selection and profile access.
    - `Game.js`: In-game page for movie guessing and hint usage.
    - `Profile.js`: User profile page with stats and leaderboards.
    - `Challenges.js`: Overview of available (unreleased) challenges for selection.

    - `helpers.js`: Helper functions (e.g., score calculation, data formatting).
    - `guessChecker.js`: Script for handling guess validation, including "Did You Mean?" functionality (disregarding capitalization, punctuation, articles, and prepositions in long titles, with 80-95% similarity suggestions and automatic 96+% matches).
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application, rendering the App component.
- `.env`: Environment variables (e.g., Firebase configuration, API keys). Note: This file is included in `.gitignore` for security.
- `/meta/`: Project metadata and documentation (ignored by Git via `.gitignore`).
  - `filestruc.txt`: This file, describing the project’s file structure.
  - `techoverview.txt`: Technical overview of the project’s architecture and dependencies.

## Notes
- All component names use PascalCase for clarity.
- Hook names start with `use` to follow React conventions.
- The `/meta` folder and `.env` are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to protect sensitive data and maintain context for developers and LLMs.
- The project prioritizes mobile-first design, using Chakra UI for consistent, accessible UI components.

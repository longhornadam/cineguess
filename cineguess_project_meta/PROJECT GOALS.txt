# CineGuess Project Goals

## Overview
A movie-guessing web game called "CineGuess" using movie metadata and screenshots as hints. 
- Target audience: Friends and family (max 50 users)
- Database: 2437 movies with TMDB metadata in JSON format
- Visual assets: ~1600 movies have 6 screenshots each in folders named by TMDB_ID
- Hosting: cineguess.plutogang.xyz (accessed from plutogang.xyz homepage)
- Primary usage: Mobile web browser (no native apps needed)

## Core Functionality

### Authentication & Profiles
- Google account login
- User-created nickname for leaderboards
- Profile page showing:
  - Overall stats and scores
  - Strengths/weaknesses (by genre, decade, etc.)
  - Option to change username
  - Opt-in/out for cloud messaging notifications

### Game Modes
- **Freeplay**: Random movie guessing
- **Challenges**: Curated sets of 10 movies with themes
- **Daily Challenge**: Same movie for all users on a given day

### Game Mechanics
- **Easy Mode**: Start with 10 points for immediate correct guess
- **Hard Mode**: Start with 15 points for immediate correct guess
- **Hint System**:
  - Progressive hints with different point costs
  - High-value hints (cast, director) cost more points
  - Low-value hints (box office, runtime) cost fewer points
  - First screenshot free, additional screenshots cost points
  - Pixelated poster as expensive hint option (progressive de-pixelation)
- **Scoring**: Points remaining after hint "purchases" = final score
- **Progress**: Save user's game history (completed/in-progress)
- **No Time Limits**: Casual, stress-free gameplay
- **Pass Option**: Skip current movie without penalty (no points awarded)

### Hints Categories (From JSON Metadata)
- Basic info (year, genre, runtime)
- Cast and crew
- Plot synopsis 
- Screenshots (6 per movie for most films)
- Pixelated poster (progressive reveal)
- Box office performance
- Awards/nominations
- Critical reception
